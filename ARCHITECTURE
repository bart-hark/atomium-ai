# Atomium Architecture

Atomium is modeled as a dynamic graph of interacting components (“cells”)
that evolve over discrete time steps.

The system is not trained via backpropagation and has no global loss function.

## Cell model

Each cell:
- maintains a continuous internal state
- receives signals from connected cells
- applies damping to prevent runaway dynamics
- does not represent a neuron or a language token

Cells can have different functional roles
(e.g. proposal, verification, stabilization, mediation).

---

## State update (conceptual)

At each time step:
1. Cells receive weighted signals from neighbors
2. Signals are aggregated with damping
3. Cell states are updated
4. Divergence between relevant cell states is evaluated

No candidate output is generated during this process.

---

## Conflict detection

Conflict is defined as sustained divergence between cell states
beyond a threshold over a sliding time window.

Conflict indicates internal inconsistency, not lack of activation.

---

## Refusal mechanism

When conflict is active:
- the output gate is hard-blocked
- no fallback or best-guess answer is produced
- the system enters a non-answering state

Refusal is an emergent property of system dynamics,
not a trained policy or confidence heuristic.

---

## Structural mediation

If conflict persists for N time steps:
- a mediator cell is introduced
- the mediator does not produce output
- it absorbs and redistributes conflicting signals
- the system topology changes instead of retraining parameters

After mediation, consensus is re-evaluated.

---

## Consensus

Consensus is defined as bounded convergence of relevant cell states
over time.

Only after consensus is restored is output allowed again.
