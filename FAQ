# FAQ

## Is this just a rule-based chatbot?
No. Rule-based chatbots refuse because they have no matching rule.
Atomium explores refusal due to **internal inconsistency**, even when activation exists.

## Is this just confidence thresholding?
No. Thresholding is typically applied at the output layer (probability/confidence).
Here, refusal is triggered by **internal conflict dynamics**.

## Is this just self-consistency / ensemble voting?
No. Many approaches generate multiple candidate answers and vote.
Atomium blocks output *before* answer generation when conflict is active.

## Is this a GNN?
It uses a graph structure, but it's not a standard trained GNN:
no backpropagation, no dataset training loop, no global loss function.
It's closer to a dynamical system on a graph.

## Is this meant to replace LLMs?
No. It can be seen as a complementary layer for reliability/verification,
especially in high-stakes contexts where guessing is unacceptable.
